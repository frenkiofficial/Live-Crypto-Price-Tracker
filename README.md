## Description

This project provides a clean interface to track the prices of various cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and many others. Prices are updated automatically without needing to refresh the page. It also includes historical price charts and lists the top gainers and losers over the last 24 hours.

## Features

âœ… **Live Price Updates:** BTC, ETH, and other token prices update automatically at a set interval.
âœ… **Historical Price Chart:** Displays interactive price movement graphs using Chart.js (Default: Bitcoin, 7 Days). Click on any coin in the table to view its chart.
âœ… **Fiat Currency Conversion:** Easily switch the displayed prices between different fiat currencies (USD, IDR, EUR supported initially).
âœ… **Top Gainers/Losers:** Shows the coins with the largest positive and negative price changes in the last 24 hours.
âœ… **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, mobiles).

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the basic structure of the web page.
*   **CSS3:** For styling, layout (including Flexbox), and responsiveness.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For fetching data, manipulating the DOM, handling user interactions, and updating content dynamically.
*   **Fetch API:** Used to make requests to the CoinGecko API without needing a backend server.
*   **Chart.js:** A popular library for creating interactive and visually appealing charts.
*   **`chartjs-adapter-date-fns`:** Required adapter for Chart.js to correctly handle time-based data on the chart axes.
